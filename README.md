## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS psuedo elements to create different displays with images in the background. I was having a difficult time altering the circle pattern in the dark blue background section and the CSS psuedo element really saved me.

I built off of my previous knowledge using the positioning properties to get items to overlap as needed.

The trickiest parts were definitley the navigation menus and adjusting them for mobile. Used CSS order properties to change div orders and I found that useful.

### Continued development

I think in the future I will fix the various sizing issues and try to break out some of the style sheets into styled components and try to combine some properties into single line declarations. Would really appreciate help on getting my eye attuned to the sizing details.

I hope to add better transitions as I got fatigued adding details to this project and didn't add them in quite yet, i.e. mobile nave bar the arrow transitions but the sub list items appear jarringly quick. Would be a quick line of code so should be an easy fix in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://letsbuildui.dev/articles/building-a-dropdown-menu-component-with-react-hooks) - This is the resource I followed trying to make the dropdown menu in react. I think I will need to reference this in the future as I am not totally confident creating this component form scratch as well as this worked.
- [Example resource 2](https://flaviocopes.com/react-hook-useref/) - This is another resource to help reinforce a "new to me" concept using the "useRef" hook.
